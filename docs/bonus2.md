# Edge Case Handling Strategy

## 1. Retry Situations

### RPC Connection Failures
**Problem**: Ethereum RPC nodes become unavailable due to network issues or maintenance.

**Strategy**:
- Use exponential backoff retry (1s → 2s → 4s → 8s → 30s max)
- Configure multiple RPC providers as fallbacks (QuickNode → Alchemy → Infura)
- Add periodic health checks to detect endpoint recovery

### Transaction Processing Failures
**Problem**: Individual transactions fail processing due to receipt unavailability or malformed data.

**Strategy**:
- Store failed transactions in database with retry metadata
- Run background worker to retry failed transactions with different backoff
- Move transactions to dead letter queue after max retries
- Alert when failure rate exceeds 5% threshold

## 2. Block Reorganization (Reorgs)

**Problem**: Blockchain reorganizations invalidate previously processed blocks and transactions.

**Strategy**:
- Store block hashes to detect parent hash mismatches
- Only consider transactions "final" after 12 block confirmations
- When reorg detected: rollback to last confirmed block, reprocess from reorg point
- Send corrective Kafka events for invalidated transactions
- Emit special reorg notifications to downstream systems

## 3. 1-Hour Downtime Recovery

**Problem**: Service downtime causes missed blocks and transactions.

**Recovery Process**:
1. **Gap Detection** (0-30s): Compare last processed block with current blockchain head
2. **Catch-up Processing** (30s-completion): Process missed blocks in batches of 20 using 5 parallel workers
3. **Real-time Resume**: Seamlessly transition to live monitoring with duplicate detection

**Performance**: ~5-10 minutes to catch up 1-hour gap (300 blocks)

## 4. Additional Edge Cases

### Address List Updates
**Problem**: New addresses need monitoring without service restart.
**Strategy**: Poll database every 5 minutes, update cache incrementally, add addresses in batches

### Network Partitions  
**Problem**: Loss of connectivity to RPC, Kafka, or Database.
**Strategy**: Buffer events locally, use connection pools with auto-reconnection, expose health endpoints

### High Volume Spikes
**Problem**: Transaction volume increases 10x during network congestion.
**Strategy**: Adaptive rate limiting, horizontal auto-scaling, priority processing for high-value addresses

### ERC-20 Complexity
**Problem**: Complex token contracts with proxy patterns or non-standard implementations.
**Strategy**: Parse multiple event types, detect proxy patterns, fallback to balance comparison, maintain contract whitelist

### Gas Price Volatility
**Problem**: Accurate fee calculation during extreme price fluctuations.
**Strategy**: Use multiple gas price oracles, cross-reference with actual network fees, support EIP-1559

## 5. Monitoring & Alerting

**Key Metrics**:
- Processing lag (block mining → event publishing)
- Error rates and RPC health
- Queue depths and memory usage

**Alert Thresholds**:
- Critical: >5min lag, >10% error rate
- Warning: >2min lag, >5% error rate

**Tools**: Prometheus + Grafana for metrics, structured logging with correlation IDs
